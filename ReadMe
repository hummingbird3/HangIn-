I'm dealing with any subjects related to maps and locations.
I've created a little android app to implement Google Maps.
It's in the zip file.

Other than that, my java classes are in HangIn/src . Feel free to check out the classes regarding maps and locations.
PS: please ignore the "Some real good classes" folder. Our java files are in the HangIn folder
