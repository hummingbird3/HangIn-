We are planning in this project to fix the communication problems between students in Bilkent Campus. Many students delay their plans because they cannot find anyone to work or spend time with them. Our projects main purpose is to create a social network that helps students to find their peers. Just a few clicks you can reach club events around the campus, you can join anyone event or you can create your event!  Your events topic depends on your imagination. You can determine the place , the time and the quota of your event. You can also access the popular events, nearby events or newly created events depending on your location on campus.    For example; just before lunch you can stick an event card to the main or nearby board. In  the card, you can say “Who wants to play basketball with me?” as well as picking the time, the quota of your event and place which you are planning to play.

As another example from someone else’s perspective; just like the guy above you can take out your phone and open the app to look for people to eat together. For that matter you can sort the main board by the “food” category, directly go to the nearby board to see what people nearby posted or even directly go to one of the student clubs board to see what they are up to for lunch! That easy. After making up your mind you can mark the event card that you are interested in as “on my way” to inform people that you are coming to… HangIn’.
